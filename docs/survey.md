# The Survey module and instrument interoperability

`PLAN.MD` section 45 is the programme; this file is the record of *why* it is
shaped the way it is. The short version: a survey that is read slightly wrong
looks exactly like a survey that is read right, so almost every decision here
buys the ability to fail loudly instead of quietly.

## What was already here

Four of the fifteen phases the brief asked for were already built, and this is
the first thing to know before touching any of it:

| Asked for | Already in the repository |
|---|---|
| Survey calculation engine | `katana::survey` - `cogo.hpp`, `traverse.hpp`, `angles.hpp`, `leveling.hpp`, `least_squares.hpp`, `network_adjustment.hpp`, `error_propagation.hpp`, `statistics.hpp` |
| Normalized survey model | `survey/data_model.hpp` - `SurveyPoint` and four observation kinds |
| Coordinate systems | `katana::geodesy` - CRS, transformer, units, ellipsoid, geodesic, grid factors, PROJ behind `src/` |
| XML reading | a strict reader, then private to `archive12d`, now `katana::core::readXml` |

So this programme is an *exchange* subsystem and a *user interface*, not a
second survey library. The conventions it obeys were set by `data_model.hpp` and
are not restated per field: metres, **radians**, azimuths clockwise in
`[0, 2*pi)`, and ordered containers so that no result depends on hashing.

## Where the manufacturer code is allowed to live

`surveyio` is a layer of its own, allowed `core;math;geometry;survey` in
`tools/check_layering.cmake`. Two absences in that list are the design.

**`cad` may not see `surveyio`**, exactly as it may not see `interop` or
`archive12d`. The brief asks that the CAD application not become dependent on
Leica, Trimble or Topcon structures. A comment saying so would be a wish; a
layering rule is a build failure. `app` and `qt` own the parsers, and `cad`
only ever sees `katana::survey` values, which it was already allowed to see.

**`geodesy` is not in the list either**, which is the more interesting one. A
parser records the coordinate system a file *declares* - a name, an EPSG code,
or explicitly unknown - and transforms nothing. The brief says never to
transform coordinates without knowing both systems; making the transformation
unreachable from the parser is stronger than remembering not to call it. The
transformation is an act the user authorises in the wizard, with both systems
named on screen.

A third consequence, inherited from `archive12d`'s reasoning: because `surveyio`
needs no third-party library, it builds with `-DKATANA_BUILD_IO=OFF`. That puts
a hand-written parser of untrusted field data under the sanitizer job, which is
where a parser of untrusted input belongs.

## The pipeline

```
field file ──> surveyio (parse only) ──> survey::SurveyProject ──> cad bridge ──> one Command ──> Document
                 declares a CRS,                                    layers, styles,      one undo step
                 transforms nothing                                 codes
```

The bridge returns a single `CommandPtr`, the same shape
`cad/survey_coding.hpp` already uses. That is what makes an entire import one
undo step, which the brief asks for in its section 19 - not a special case, just
the command pattern the application already has.

## How five parsers were written at once without colliding

Each format registers itself from its own translation unit through
`FormatRegistration` (`include/katana/surveyio/format.hpp`), and
`src/katana_surveyio/` is globbed. Adding a parser is adding a file: no shared
table, no shared CMake list, nothing for two authors to edit at the same time.

That design has one trap, and it was measured rather than guessed. A linker
pulls a member out of a static archive only to satisfy an undefined symbol, and
a self-registering object file defines nothing anyone references - so it is
dropped, the format vanishes from the registry, and the only symptom is a file
being reported as unrecognised months later. The measurements are recorded in
`src/katana_surveyio/CMakeLists.txt`; the outcome is that the module is an
`INTERFACE` target wrapping its archive in `WHOLE_ARCHIVE`, so that no consumer
has to remember the rule. A correctness rule that must be remembered in `app`,
in `qt` and in every future consumer is a rule that will be forgotten in one of
them.

## What "supported" is allowed to mean

The brief's section 23 is the rule and the UI carries it. A `FormatDescriptor`
states the exact variant, what it can carry, whether import and export work, and
the version of *this parser*. So the application says

> Leica GSI-16 - import: yes, export: yes, parser 1.0

and never "all Leica files supported". Three consequences:

- **Nothing is implemented from a guessed binary layout.** Formats whose
  structure is proprietary and undocumented are refused *by name*, with a
  message saying why and what to export instead. Refusing a Trimble `.job`
  clearly is a feature; guessing at it is the thing the brief forbids.
- **Detection returns a ranked list with an explicit uncertain outcome** that a
  caller cannot ignore, so an unknown file is never handed to an incompatible
  parser. A probe sees the first few kilobytes and the file's *name* - never a
  path, and never anything it could open.
- **Every candidate carries its evidence** ("extension .gsi, every record 24
  bytes, word 11 first"), because a detection a person has to second-guess is
  one they cannot check.

## The two ways survey data gets silently corrupted

Both are called out here, and in `PLAN.MD` 45.5, because a test that does not
aim at them will pass straight over the bug.

**GSI encodes the decimal position inside the word.** It is not a decimal point
in the data. Read the data block as a plain integer and the coordinate comes out
wrong by orders of magnitude - and still looks like a survey coordinate. Every
expected metre value in the GSI tests is worked out by hand from the
specification with the arithmetic in a comment, per `CLAUDE.md` section 3.

**Coordinate order differs between families.** LandXML `CgPoint` content and
Trimble exports are northing-first; much else is easting-first. A transposed
survey is the worst kind of defect: it is self-consistent, it plots, and it is
in the wrong place. Where a file is genuinely ambiguous the importer is *told*,
never left to guess, and the fixtures use northing and easting of unmistakably
different magnitudes (northing 5 000 000 against easting 500 000) so that a
transposition cannot pass a test by coincidence.

## Test fixtures

Constructed from specifications, in `tests/surveyio/data/`. No proprietary
sample files are used, which the brief requires and which also means the
fixtures can say what they are testing: a hand-built record exercising one
documented field is worth more than a real file that happens to contain it.

## Compatibility matrix

Filled in as each parser lands, and it states formats and variants rather than
manufacturers. Anything not listed here is not supported, whatever its
extension.
